my workflow: 

5 group members total 

<MEMBER ROLES>
-> 1 group member does the coding
	- 2 other people are to support, come up with ideas, or check with each other

-> 1-2 people write the project report
	- they are to proofread each other writings
	- check in with the coders to 

-> 1-2 people are chosen to present the results
	- presents the group project findings
	- multiple people can split parts and agree which parts they want to present

<TRACKING CHANGES>
-> make sure the changes are committed and track on a shared GitHub repository 
	- commits must have messages
		- these messages must include the specific line and what was being changed 
-> ensure that everyone in the group is kept up to date of the changes being made
	- each members branch must be merged when committing changes
